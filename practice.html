    <!-- HTML Events
    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
    
    Here are some examples of HTML events:
    
    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked -->

    <!-- With single quotes:

<element event='some JavaScript'>
With double quotes:

<element event="some JavaScript"> -->
<!-- Event	Description
onchange - 	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	- The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover -	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout -	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	- The user pushes a keyboard key

onload -	The browser has finished loading the page -->

<!-- JavaScript Event Handlers
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

Things that should be done every time a page loads
Things that should be done when the page is closed
Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
And more ...
Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
You can prevent events from being sent or being handled -->
